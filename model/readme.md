Hello! I build models including linear regression, logistic regression, random forest and XGboost based on independent variables: population from 1950 - 2024 and geolocation after encoding(x, y, z), and the dependent variable is the meteorites landing year. all the data i used is without unknown data

the conclusion is random forest is the model with best performance. also, there are still future works to do

1. what could be the better dependent variable instead of using the landing year

2. is there any other model we can make for those unkown country data
