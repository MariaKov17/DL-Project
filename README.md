# When Human Geography Meets Cosmic Events

_Disentangling Socio-Economic Biases in Meteorite Landing Records Using Machine Learning_

Welcome to the repository for our research project exploring how human socio-economic factors shape the recording of meteorite events. This project dives into the interplay between cosmic phenomena and human geography from 1950 to 2013, leveraging machine learning to uncover hidden patterns in the data.

## Overview

- **Objective:**  
  We investigate how factors such as population density, GDP per capita, and educational infrastructure influence meteorite landing reports. Our models reveal that human activity leaves its mark even on datasets of natural phenomena.

- **Methodology:**  
  - **Data Collection & Cleaning:**  
    Datasets from NASA, World Bank, IMF, IPEDS, UIS, and census records are aggregated annually (1950–2013). We filtered, cleaned, and aligned the data to ensure consistency.
  - **Visualization:**  
    - A timeline plot shows the cumulative count of meteorite landings.
    - Spatial maps overlay meteorite locations with population density heatmaps.
  - **Modeling:**  
    Three predictive models were built:
    - **Linear Regression**
    - **Random Forest**
    - **Neural Network**  
      Our neural network (with two hidden layers and ReLU activations) scored an impressive \(R^2 = 0.7\).

- **Key Findings:**  
  - Socio-economic factors significantly affect meteorite landing records.
  - Regions with higher population density and better educational infrastructure tend to have more reported events.
