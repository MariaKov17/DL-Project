mergeandgeo.ipynb the file using based on data cleaned_meteorite_landing_from_1950.csv
after assigning geolocation data with API and solve some nominal problems, i get the data landing_data_clean
which means u can use landing_data_clean.csv(it is clean i believe as i've done as much as i can) to your further work


also merged_data.csv is just the landing_data_clean merged with population
